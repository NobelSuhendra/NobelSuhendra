<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Nobelüëã</h1>

- I'm a Y10 student at **NationalHigh Jakarta School**. I primarily focus on competitive programming, though occassionally I do web and app development, video editing, and graphic design. In my free time, you can find me practicing badminton, feeding on my card throwing obsession or perhaps playing video games.

# üî≠ Projects

- The project I'm currently working on is: [School4All](https://linktr.ee/school4all), a non-profit organisation based in Jakarta, Indonesia with the goal of improving the education for the underpriviliged. 

- My winning project for the Hwa Chong Institution Project Competition: [UpLift](https://team-uplift.com), an organisation with the primary goal of raising awareness about mental health, through blogging and charity work.

- Some of my business projects: 

1. [Khione](https://instagram.com/khione.jkt), an ice-cream-selling charity organisation which donates profits earned from selling homemade, luxury ice cream to a better cause.

2. BioPoll, a business start-up which makes use of biometric technologies to improve the accuracy, convenience, and feasibility of online voting. (Top 100 YTBC)
